# Kernels security

`kernels` downloads and loads remote code, so you need clear trust boundaries.
We aim to address the following attack vectors:

- A kernel developer ships malicious code inside a kernel.
- The Hub credentials of a kernel developer are compromised and an attacker uses
  them to add malicious code to a kernel.

We do not aim to address the following attack vectors:

- Local Hub cache manipulation if the manipulation is done by the attacker on
  the system that loads the kernels. The reasoning here is that the attacker
  could do anything at this point, including tampering with the software that
  loads the kernel.

Improving kernel security is an ongoing effort, and we welcome feedback and
contributions.

## Malicious kernel developers

As a `kernels` user, ask two trust questions before you load a kernel:

- Do I trust the developer?
- Do I trust the developer to properly secure their infrastructure and
  credentials?

`kernels` also blocks accidental loads from publishers you have not opted into,
such as from trusted publishers, the
[kernels-community](https://huggingface.co/kernels-community), and kernel
provenance.

### Trusted publishers

A trusted publisher is a kernel developer who is deemed reputable by the Hugging
Face kernels team. The trusted publisher status is queried from the Hub when
downloading a kernel.

The set of trusted publishers is intentionally very small and generally only
contains organizations that have years of experience in developing kernels and
maintaining secure build infrastructure.

By default, a call such as

```python
activation = get_kernel("someorg/activation", version=1)
```

will raise an exception unless `someorg` is a trusted publisher.

Pass `trust_remote_code=True` to allow any publisher, or pass a list of repo IDs
to allow only those repos (plus trusted publishers). The default is `False` to
always block unknown publishers.

```python
activation = get_kernel(
    "someorg/activation",
    version=1,
    trust_remote_code=["someorg/activation"]
)
```

If your library loads kernels on behalf of its users, expose a flag so they can
control untrusted publishers. For example:

```python
TRUST_REMOTE_KERNELS = os.environ.get("MYLIB_TRUST_REMOTE_KERNELS", "0") == "1"

activation = get_kernel(
    "someorg/activation",
    version=1,
    trust_remote_code=["someorg/activation"] if TRUST_REMOTE_KERNELS else False
)
```

### kernels-community

The [kernels-community](https://huggingface.co/kernels-community/kernels)
organization provides a large number of kernels that are maintained by Hugging
Face. Kernels from this organization are publicly maintained through
[GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/kernels-community) and are built using
ephemeral build containers. PRs that are merged into kernels-community go
through an automated security audit and can only be merged by a very small group
of maintainers.

The kernels-community organization is a trusted publisher, so it provides good
kernel coverage out of the box.

### Kernel provenance

You can also check that a build came from the claimed source. Every kernel built
with kernel-builder records provenance in the build variant's `metadata.json`,
including the Git commits of:

- The revision of kernel-builder that the kernel was built with.
- The revision of the kernel source itself.

This information is stored in the build variant's `metadata.json`. For example:

```json
"provenance": {
  "kernel-builder": {
    "version": "0.17.0-dev0",
    "commit": "a7f0afdb29a6a3372b1d47180cc0c182454c5e3b",
    "dirty": false
  },
  "kernel": {
    "commit": "a137a8498a30a98631a3deedfa44ea01bf1cef7c",
    "dirty": false
  }
}
```

For a full example, see the
[flash-attn3 kernel](https://huggingface.co/kernels/kernels-community/flash-attn3/blob/v2/build/torch-stable-abi29-cu126-x86_64-linux/metadata.json).

This provenance information can be used to rebuild the kernel at the exact same
revisions of the kernel and the builder. A binary diff between the remote build
and your local build can help reveal any tampering.

Kernel builds are largely reproducible because kernels are built using Nix
inside a sandbox. `kernel-builder` pins the full toolchain (compiler, C library,
etc.) in `flake.lock`. You can find these pins in the
[kernels](https://github.com/huggingface/kernels) repository.

## Kernel compromises

Even if you trust a kernel developer, their credentials might be compromised. An
attacker could use the credentials to upload a malicious version of a kernel.
`kernels` offers two protections against these attack vectors:

- Kernel locking
- Code signing

### Kernel locking

Kernel locking records the Git commit hash of a kernel in a `kernels.lock` file.
After the kernel is locked, load it with `get_locked_kernel` (downloads if
needed) or `load_kernel` (requires a pre-downloaded kernel and errors if it is
missing). Either path only loads the locked commit. If an attacker compromises a
kernel Hub repository and pushes a new, malicious version, it will not be used.
See [Lock kernel versions](./locking) for how to lock the kernels of a
project.

An attacker can circumvent the lock by trying to craft a commit that collides
with the SHA-1 hash. However, this is currently hard, since the Hugging Face Hub
platform uses a Git implementation with SHA-1 collision detection
([sha1dc](https://github.com/cr-marcstevens/sha1collisiondetection)).

### Code signing

`kernels` can verify kernels with cosign.

On load, `kernels` checks that the files match signed digests in
`metadata.json`. Signing uses cosign with short-lived keys, and the signature is
recorded in a [ledger](https://docs.sigstore.dev/logging/overview/). That
combination makes leaked CI signing keys much harder to reuse.

The builder computes the SHA-256 digest of each file in the kernel and stores it
in `metadata.json`:

```json
"digest": {
  "algorithm": "sha256",
  "files": {
    "__init__.py": "iY6XPtdZUgS8HizpndYTF+U/5kUmeLsADwCNM0UXMME=",
    "_ops.py": "5ecEPtZkkJLggvzM/luMYUmHIpCZXiBMEwXG0GmIMBU=",
    "_rmsnorm_xpu_89d4054.abi3.so": "yb8gSiUShkgjnrdDNTPJ0prhLPQAvTIFWwbllgqK5po=",
    "layers.py": "8KMmxy30Olm/16XW7vvHAwWNVWcnA8js0nNuoOSGEO8="
  }
}
```

Aside from the main signature, cosign also records information about how the
signature was made, such as the OIDC issuer, the source repository, and the
workflow path/branch.

Signature verification performs the following steps:

- Verify the signature against the given policy. The default policy only accepts
  kernels signed by workflows in the `huggingface/kernels-community` GitHub
  repository.
- Verify the authenticity of `metadata.json` using the signature.
- Use the digests in `metadata.json` to verify the kernel files.

At this time, a signature verification error will only result in a warning.
Moreover, signature verification is only performed when the `sigstore` Python
package is installed. However, we will make signature verification mandatory in
the future.

The same steps can be performed on demand with the
[`kernels verify-signature`](cli-verify-signature) command.

#### Signature verification receipts

To avoid the high cost of signature verification, a kernel is only verified in
full once. The first time a kernel is loaded, we perform all the steps above.
Upon successful verification, we write a receipt file to the kernels cache.

When a receipt is found on a later load, the signature and digest checks are
skipped. The signing certificate is still checked against the policy, since the
receipt could have been written by a verification with a different policy.

Receipts are stored by kernel identity. The name of a receipt file is a hash of:

- The repo ID
- The Git commit hash
- The build variant

This means that downloading a different revision or build variant of the same
kernel will not collide with the existing receipt and will be verified as
expected.
